This is my take on an archive bruteforcer, but I have to warn you that there are bugs and unimplemented features left in this project. RAR files are unsupported because I couldn't get RarLab's UnRAR DLL to work, only ZIP files are supported, you could read the source code to see all the problems the project is currently having. I'm not sure that I would come back to finish this project.
